    "# Categorial Variables with Linear and Nonlinear Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Three types of variables are used, particularly in linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Continuous - ordered and can be subdivided.\n",
    "2. Categorical - limited and fixed number of values.\n",
    "3. Ordinal - limited and fixed number of values for which order is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical variables are sometimes referred to as *levels* (particularly in R). They are often called [*dummy variables*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics)) in the statistics literature and indicate membership in a category. But see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical use case for ordinal variables is a survey where `1` represents \"strongly disagree\" and `5` represents \"strongly agree\". A later talk will address the use of ordinal variables in modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual numbers for categorical variables do not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differences in Languages (Packages)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to encode variables for use in `scikit-learn` as the package only takes numeric categories. `R` takes \"levels\" and encodes internally. So you can pass strings as categories to models in `R`, but not in `scikit-learn`.\n",
